            </div>
        
            <p>Various American universities, particularly Ivy League institutions, have faced threats of federal funding cuts from the Trump administration since March 2025. These threats are based on allegations that universities failed to protect against "civil rights violations" and tolerated "anti-semitism" on their campuses. Six of the eight Ivy League universities have already seen significant federal cuts planned.
            </p>

            <p>This situation has created anxiety within these institutions about managing budgets and funding ongoing research projects. It also impacts the fundamental character of these universities, which have historically been centers for academic freedom, innovation, and the cultivation of diverse thoughts and ideologies.</p>   
            <p>The potential consequences extend beyond the universities themselves, as America's scientific and medical research capabilities are deeply connected with its university system. This relationship has been part of a national compact that began after World War II to develop expertise and knowledge for the country's benefit.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of $6.8 trillion in total federal spending for fiscal year 2023-2024, the U.S. federal government has spent about $85 billion directly on US universities. This represents about 1.25% of total federal spending.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The largest portion of this funding was allocated to research activities, with medical and STEM fields receiving the highest levels of support. This doesn't include indirect benefits to universities from federal student loan programs where payments go directly to students and not the institutions</p>
            <p>According to Congressional Budget Office, More than $6 billion is spent on the eight Ivy Leagues out of this total federal funds to the universities. These institutions form 8% of such funding and only 0.5 % of the total American universities.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Columbia University received about $1.3 billions of federal funds in the fiscal year 2023-24. This is the highest proportion of the  operating revenue among all the ivies. The university is highly dependent on the funds that it gets as part of patient care and net tuition fees. In March 2025, the Trump administration threatened the university with a cut of $400 million if it does not overhaul its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department. </p>
            <p>Columbia University relies most heavily on federal funding among Ivy League institutions, with federal dollars comprising 20% of its operating budget, followed by Princeton (18%), Cornell (16%), and Yale (15%), while Brown and Dartmouth both receive 12%, and Penn and Harvard are least dependent at just 11% each, despite Penn receiving the largest total federal allocation in absolute dollars.</p>

            <p>Such funds that universities receive from the federal government are often in the form of grants and used for research and development, facility and administrative costs and student aid. The administration had threatened the university on incompetency to address antisemitism on campus. Despite the university accepting the changes, it is still vulnerable to losing the amount. </p>        
            
            <p>The Trump administration paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports in 2022.</p>

            <p>The administration has targeted six leagues for punitive funding cuts or explicitly warned them about serious funding risks. Brown University faces a potential $510 million loss. Cornell University confronts a minimum cut of $1 billion. Princeton University indicated risk of losing $210 million</p>

            <p>Ivy leagues receive a large amount of endowments every year.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced in March that it was reviewing approximately $256 million in federal contracts with Harvard, along with an additional $8.7 billion in what they called "multiyear grant commitments." The administration suggested that Harvard had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus, though they didn't provide specific details about what actions the university should take to address their concerns.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harvard-plans-borrow-750-million-after-federal-funding-threats-2025-04-07/">Harvard University plans to borrow $750 million</a> from Wall Street as part of contingency preparations.</p>
            
            <p>Harvard has the largest endowment of any US university, a $53 billion. All the seven ivies are among the top 20 colleges in the US which gather the largest endowments, except for the Brown University. </p>

            <p>Most of the endowments are legally tied up, donors specified exactly what it can be used for like scholarships or specific research areas.
            </p>

            <p> Federal grants pay for very specific research projects,  they cover salaries, equipment, and support for graduate students. The endowment money usually doesn't have the flexibility to replace these specialized funds.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Each year, each of these universities can only use about 5% of the endowment amount in the year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The sudden halt of federal funding threatens critical research that saves and improves lives, with impacts extending well beyond our university grounds for generations. This crisis has sparked widespread anxiety - not just among directly affected researchers, but especially among students and early-career faculty who have committed their futures to scientific discovery and now face uncertain professional paths.
            </p>

            <p>As reported by various new reports, universities nationwide are scrambling to reduce expenses and create breathing room as President Trump's campaign to cut funding for select institutions gains momentum. The impact extends far beyond campus boundaries, education experts warn these funding reductions will damage not just academic communities but also the local economies that depend on universities. Perhaps most concerning is the potential long-term erosion of America's global competitive edge as research and innovation suffer from diminished resources.
            </p>

            <p> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5324496/universities-hiring-freezes-federal-funding">Many universities</a> have said that the hiring pauses are for the time being, and will be reviewed when they have more information about the status of federal support.
            </p>

            <p>"It is meant to preserve our financial flexibility until we better understand how changes in federal policy will take shape and can assess the scale of their impact," Harvard President Alan Garber <a href= "https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/financial-stewardship/">wrote in his announcement recently</a>.</p>
            <p><a href = "https://politico.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-administration-freezes-millions-at-cornell-and-northwestern-00280681">Cornell has become the sixth </a>Ivy League institution to face a federal cut. Yale University and Dartmouth College are the only two left that have not yet receive similar warnings by the federal administration.
            </p>

            <p>While it is uncertain how much of these cuts get actualised, it is becoming clearer about how much universities could lose if Trump succeeds in limiting NIH funding, which supports most US medical research. The policy change has already triggered multiple lawsuits and is currently blocked by a federal judge. NIH is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research and covers "indirect costs" like facilities and administration, rates that vary between universities. 
            </p>

            <p>Trump wants to cap these indirect costs at just 15% of grants, potentially costing universities millions and forcing them to either cut other programs or compromise on research administration, risking accounting problems and regulatory non-compliance.
